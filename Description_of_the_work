This is the exercise that I have:
// Object: Book
// Title: up to 40 characters
// Author: up to 30 characters
// Number of pages – integer, non-negative number
// Price – real, positive number

// Methods:
// 1. Create a "Book" with a specific author, title, and number of pages.
// 2. "Tear off" a specified number of pages from the book (if possible).
// 3. Create set and get methods.
// 4. Display the properties of the object.
// 5. The task should be testable.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Create an array of books.
// Display the books by the given author.
// Return the average price of the booкс
I solved the problem in two ways. The first way is for the values to be entered via the scanner, and the second is for them to be added through a text file.
In file books you can see the class where I added the values then you can see two files one with the name "test_book" and the other "test_file"."test_book" is the file where you can add values via scanner,
whereas file "test_file" is the file which reads from the text document with the name "Books.txt"
